David's Digital Den - Online Game Store

Created by David Segui Jr. - Fall 2025

I created this website as my senior project for my Information Systems major at Florida Gulf Coast University. It was my first time every creating a website for a non-leisure project.
The professor had us each create a fully functional website using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. His criteria was that, by Thanksgiving break, we would all have a
website that allowed for full navigation across all pages, supported user creation and maintenance using a local database with PHPMyAdmin and SQL, and followed several creative design
principles he taught us about. As this was many of the students' first times using JavaScript and PHP (including mine), he allowed us to use GenAI to create some of the code, provided
that we could still demonstrate an understanding of what the AI-generated code did when asked about it and that we could explain it piece-by-piece. All of the HTML and CSS was done by
hand with very little outside help. Normally, I would organize CSS by-line rather than having it all on a single line, but the professor said that he found it easier to read css code
when it was written on a single line, rather than broken up. To demonstrate the differences, I reorganized the about.html page to have the CSS styling look how I would normally write
it if I were doing this for leisure, while all other pages have it written the way the professor requested.
